# Introduction

This project contains different libraries that are commonly used in the Peppol area:
  * [`peppol-id`](#peppol-id) - the ID data structures (since v7.0.0)
  * [`peppol-commons`](#peppol-commons) - the most basic data structures for use with Peppol and BDXR
  * [`peppol-testfiles`](#peppol-testfiles) - a set of UBL and SBDH test files
  * [`peppol-sbdh`](#peppol-sbdh) - Peppol specific SBDH handling
  * [`peppol-sml-client`](#peppol-sml-client) - the Peppol SML client
  * [`peppol-smp-client`](#peppol-smp-client) - the Peppol SMP and BDXR SMP client
  
These project are used implicitly by the following projects:
  * [phoss-directory](https://github.com/phax/phoss-directory/) - the phoss Directory for Peppol and TOOP
  * [phoss-smp](https://github.com/phax/phoss-smp/) - the phoss SMP server with a management GUI
  * [as2-peppol](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol/) - an AS2 client and server for Peppol
  * [phase4](https://github.com/phax/phase4/) - an AS4 implementation that also supports Peppol 
  
And some legacy Peppol projects:
  * [peppol-lime](https://github.com/phax/peppol-lime/) - the LIME server with AS2 support

This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## peppol-id

Java library with shared IDs.
First created in version 7.0.0.

Make sure to run `mvn generate-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

## peppol-commons

Java library with shared Peppol components. It contains the basic algorithms. Since v7 this depends on the `peppol-id` submodule.

Make sure to run `mvn generate-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

### Truststore path change in v6.0.1

Old path names (up to and including v6.0.0):
* truststore/global-truststore.jks (production only PKI v2)
* truststore/pilot-truststore.jks (pilot only PKI v2)
* truststore/complete-truststore.jks (production + pilot PKI v2)

New path names (starting from v6.0.1):
* truststore/2010/prod-truststore.jks (production only PKI v2)
* truststore/2010/pilot-truststore.jks (pilot only PKI v2)
* truststore/2018/prod-truststore.jks (production only PKI v3)
* truststore/2018/pilot-truststore.jks (pilot only PKI v3)
* truststore/complete-truststore.jks (production + pilot PKI v2 + v3)

## peppol-sbdh

Simple SBDH handler for the use with Peppol.
It offers the possibility to extract all meta data from an SBDH document as well as 
set all meta data to an SBDH document.

Make sure to run `mvn generate-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

This projects implements the "Envelope specification" as listed on
http://www.peppol.eu/ressource-library/technical-specifications/transport-infrastructure/infrastructure-resources.
The detail document this project refers to can be found at
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/svn/peppol/TransportInfrastructure/ICT-Transport-OpenPEPPOL-Envelope_Specification-100_2014-01-15.pdf

An example on how to use this project can be found in my **[as2-peppol-servlet](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol)** project which provides a servlet to receive incoming Peppol AS2 messages. Alternatively you may have a look at my **[as2-peppol-client](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol)** project which is used to send Peppol AS2 messages.

## peppol-testfiles

A Java library with a lot of UBL and SBDH test files suitable for different scenarios.  

SimpleInvoicing test files are used from https://github.com/SimplerInvoicing/testset

## peppol-sml-client

This project contains the SML client library used by the SMP's to interact with the SML.
It is based on cipa-sml-client-library 2.2.3.
This library is usually only used within SMP servers, to communicate the changes to the central SML.

Make sure to run `mvn generate-sources` before using it in the IDE.
The additional code is created in `target/generated-sources/xjc`. 

This project contains 2 main classes for talking to the Peppol SML:
  * `ManageServiceMetadataServiceCaller` which is used to change SMP assignments in the SML. This must be called for a new SMP to register it once at the SML.
  * `ManageParticipantIdentifierServiceCaller` which is used to manage the assignment of participants to SMPs. This must be invoked from the SMP server every time a new participant is registered (or an existing one is modified or deleted).
  
Both classes offer the possibility to set an optional custom `SSLSocketFactory` as well as a custom optional `HostnameVerifier`. The implementation of this is in the base class `AbstractSMLClientCaller`.

This project is used by [peppol-smp-server](https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server/) the SMP server with a management GUI and flexible backends.

## peppol-smp-client

This project holds the SMP client library used by the access points to retrieve service metadata. It is based on cipa-smp-client-library 2.2.3. This project also contains the BDXR SMP client (since version 4.3.0). 
This project uses Apache HTTP client to perform the REST lookups on foreign SMPs. The reason to not use the Jersey 1.x client is an incompatibility with Java 8. This means that this version is compliant with Java 1.6+.

I also provide an OSS [phoss SMP server](https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server) with a nice management GUI.

### Configuration
The SMP client (both Peppol and BDXR) uses the file `smp-client.properties` for configuration. The default file resides in the folder `src/main/resources` of this project. You can change the path of the properties file by setting the environment variable `SMP_CLIENT_CONFIG` (since v7.0.7), the system property `peppol.smp.client.properties.path` (since v4.3.5), the system property `smp.client.properties.path` (available as of version 4.2.0) to the absolute path of the configuration file (e.g. by specifying `-Dsmp.client.properties.path=/var/www/smpclient.properties` on Java startup). The name of the file does not matter, but if you specify a different properties file please make sure that you also specify an absolute path to e.g. the trust store!

It supports the following properties:
* **`truststore.type`** (since v6.0.0): the type of key store to be used. Possible values are `JKS` and `PKCS12`. Defaults to `JKS` (which was the implicit default prior to v6).
* **`truststore.path`** (name before v6: **`truststore.location`**): the location of the Peppol trust store (of the specified type) to be used. If this property is not defined, the value defaults to `truststore/complete-truststore.jks`. By default the SMP client supports the following built-in trust stores (in library [peppol-commons](https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons)):
    * `truststore/complete-truststore.jks` - contains the trust certificates for production and pilot (root, AP, SMP, STS)
    * `truststore/global-truststore.jks` - contains the trust certificates for production only (root, AP, SMP, STS)
    * `truststore/pilot-truststore.jks` - contains the trust certificates for pilot only (root, AP, SMP, STS)
* **`truststore.password`**: the password to access the trust store. By default the password `peppol` is used. This password is valid for all built-in trust stores mentioned above.
* **`http.proxyHost`**: the host name or IP address to be used as a HTTP proxy for **all** hosts. If you need proxy exemptions than the `http.useSystemProperties` is the configuration item of choice.
* **`http.proxyPort`**: the port of the HTTP proxy. The port must be specified and has no default value! If you need proxy exemptions than the `http.useSystemProperties` is the configuration item of choice.
* **`http.proxyUsername`** (since v5.2.5): the username for the HTTP proxy. This property takes only effect if proxy host and proxy port are defined. 
* **`http.proxyPassword`** (since v5.2.5): the password for the HTTP proxy. This property takes only effect if proxy host, proxy port and proxy username are defined. 
* **`http.useSystemProperties`** (since v5.2.4): if `true` the system properties (=JVM properties) for HTTP configuration are used for setting up the connection. This implies that the properties `http.proxyHost`, `http.proxyPort`, `http.proxyUsername` and `http.proxyPassword` are ineffective! The default value is `false`.
* **`http.connect.timeout.ms`** (since 7.0.4): set the connection timeout in milliseconds. The default value is `5000` meaning 5 seconds.
* **`http.request.timeout.ms`** (since 7.0.4): set the request timeout in milliseconds. The default value is `10000` meaning 10 seconds.
  
### Specifying a proxy server

A proxy server can be specified in two ways:
* A single proxy server for **all** hosts - no exemptions. This can be specified in the configuration file for all `SMPClient` instances or per `SMPClient` instance (same for BDXR client - for all clients based on `AbstractGenericSMPClient`).
* A more complex setup based on the JVM system properties (based on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html). This can also be specified in the configuration file to enable the usage for all `SMPClient` instances or on a per-instance basis.

**Specify a global proxy server**
The SMP client supports a proxy server. By default the proxy specified in the configuration file (see above) is used (since version 4.3.0).

Alternatively call the method `setProxy (org.apache.http.HttpHost)` on an `SMPClient` or `SMPClientReadOnly`. This means you can specify the proxy on a per-call basis.
Proxy authentication is available since v5.2.5 by invoking `setProxyCredentials (org.apache.http.auth.Credentials)` on the SMP or BDXR client.

**Using the JVM system properties**
Since v5.2.2 the method `SMPClient.setUseProxySystemProperties (true)` can be used to enable the usage of the default system properties for HTTP connections (see the section on the configuration file for details). Since v5.2.4 the configuration file property `http.useSystemProperties` can be used to achieve the same without code changes. By enabling the usage of the system properties, the manually set proxy is ignored; if a proxy is manually set after this setting, it disables the usage of the system properties again.
Note: this of course works for both SMP and BDXR client.

Supported system properties are (based on Apache HTTPClient):
  * `ssl.TrustManagerFactory.algorithm`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStore`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStoreProvider`
  * `javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword`
  * `ssl.KeyManagerFactory.algorithm`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStore`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStoreProvider`
  * `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword`
  * `https.protocols`
  * `https.cipherSuites`
  * `http.proxyHost`
  * `http.proxyPort`
  * `http.nonProxyHosts`
  * `http.keepAlive`
  * `http.maxConnections`
  * `http.agent`
  
### Example usage

Get the endpoint URL for a participant using a special document type and process:
```java
    // The Peppol participant identifier
    final PeppolParticipantIdentifier aPI_AT_Test = PeppolParticipantIdentifier.createWithDefaultScheme ("9915:test");

    // Create the main SMP client using the production SML
    final SMPClientReadOnly aSMPClient = new SMPClientReadOnly (PeppolURLProvider.INSTANCE,
                                                                aPI_AT_Test,
                                                                ESML.DIGIT_PRODUCTION);
    final String sEndpointAddress = aSMPClient.getEndpointAddress (aPI_AT_Test,
                                                                   EPredefinedDocumentTypeIdentifier.INVOICE_T010_BIS4A_V20,
                                                                   EPredefinedProcessIdentifier.BIS4A_V20,
                                                                   ESMPTransportProfile.TRANSPORT_PROFILE_AS2);
    // Endpoint address should be "https://test.erechnung.gv.at/as2"
    System.out.println ("The Austrian government test AS2 AP that handles invoices in BIS4A V2.0 is located at: " +
                        sEndpointAddress);
```

If you don't need the DNS lookup you can use the URL of the SMP directly (equivalent to the previous example):
```java
    // The Peppol participant identifier
    final PeppolParticipantIdentifier aPI_AT_Test = PeppolParticipantIdentifier.createWithDefaultScheme ("9915:test");

    // Create the main SMP client using the production SML
    final SMPClientReadOnly aSMPClient = new SMPClientReadOnly (URLHelper.getAsURI ("http://B-85008b8279e07ab0392da75fa55856a2.iso6523-actorid-upis.edelivery.tech.ec.europa.eu"));
    final String sEndpointAddress = aSMPClient.getEndpointAddress (aPI_AT_Test,
                                                                   EPredefinedDocumentTypeIdentifier.INVOICE_T010_BIS4A_V20,
                                                                   EPredefinedProcessIdentifier.BIS4A_V20,
                                                                   ESMPTransportProfile.TRANSPORT_PROFILE_AS2);

    // Endpoint address should be "https://test.erechnung.gv.at/as2"
    System.out.println ("The Austrian government test AS2 AP that handles invoices in BIS4A V2.0 is located at: " +
                        sEndpointAddress);
```

# Building from source

This project is meant to be build by Maven 3.x.
It requires at least Java 1.8 to be build.
To build simply call `mvn clean install` in the root folder.

When integrating this in your IDE, ensure to run `mvn process-sources` first, so that the automatically generated files are present.
For the subprojects `peppol-id`, `peppol-commons`, `peppol-sbdh` and `peppol-sml-client` add `target/generated-sources/xjc` to your buildpath afterwards.

# Maven usage
Add the following to your pom.xml to use this artifact, replacing `x.y.z` with the latest version number (see below):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-id</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-commons</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-testfiles</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-sbdh</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-sml-client</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-smp-client</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively use the following code in your `dependencyManagement` section to use it as a BOM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.peppol</groupId>
  <artifactId>peppol-commons-parent-pom</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

Note: prior to v8.1.0 the Maven groupId was `com.helger`.

The binary version of this library can be found on https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/helger/peppol/ 
They depend on several other libraries so I suggest you are going for the Maven source integration.
